Of course. This is a very insightful and professional analysis that raises critical, actionable points. The SRD is not complete until these details are specified.

Here is a revised "v3.0" of the Game Mechanics and Requirements document. This version incorporates your team's feedback, resolves the identified gaps, and provides the necessary implementation and process specifications to begin development.

---

## **Octa-Core C++ Port: Game Mechanics & Requirements (v3.0)**

**Document Purpose:** This document (v3.0) is the definitive specification for the C++ port of the Octa-Core game logic. It resolves all issues identified in the v0.2 SRD review and should be considered the "source of truth" for implementation.

### 1. System Architecture & Data Models

#### 1.1. Map Abstraction (`IGameMap`)
The architecture will use an abstract `IGameMap` interface to decouple the engine from the map's underlying data structure. The initial concrete implementation will be `GraphGameMap`, using a `std::unordered_map` for cell storage.

#### 1.2. Core Data Models

**`GameCell` (Resolution to Data Model Mismatch)**
To align with the original, more expressive Java model, the `GameCell` class **must** contain the following state members:
```cpp
class GameCell {
private:
    Coordinate coordinate_;
    CellState state_;       // REQUIRED: e.g., NEUTRAL, PLAYER_1, BLOCKED
    Direction direction_;   // REQUIRED: The cell's current arrow direction
    // ... neighbors
};
```
The `Player occupant_` concept is superseded by `CellState`.

**`Direction` System (Resolution to System Gap)**
The `Direction` enum's rotation logic is critical.
* **Implementation**: It shall be implemented as a set of free `inline` helper functions in the `Direction.h` header.
* **Required Functions**:
    ```cpp
    // In Direction.h
    inline Direction rotateClockwise(Direction dir) {
        return static_cast<Direction>((static_cast<int>(dir) + 1) % 8);
    }

    inline Direction rotateCounterClockwise(Direction dir) {
        return static_cast<Direction>((static_cast<int>(dir) + 8 - 1) % 8);
    }
    ```

### 2. Game Logic (`IGameLogic`)

#### 2.1. `IGameLogic` Interface
The `IGameLogic` interface is defined as follows:
```cpp
class IGameLogic {
public:
    virtual ~IGameLogic() = default;
    virtual bool isValidMove(std::shared_ptr<const GameCell> cell, Player player) const = 0;
    virtual GameResult makeMove(std::shared_ptr<GameCell> cell, Player player) = 0;
    virtual bool isGameOver() const = 0;
    virtual Player getCurrentPlayer() const = 0;
    virtual void switchPlayer() = 0;
    virtual int getTurnCount() const = 0;
    virtual const GameConfig& getConfig() const = 0;
};
```

#### 2.2. State Management (Ownership Specification)
* **`GameConfig`**: The `OctaGameLogic` instance **owns** the `GameConfig` object. It should be initialized in the `OctaGameLogic` constructor.
* **`GameResult`**: `makeMove` returns a `GameResult` by value. The final game-over result is stored in an `std::optional<GameResult>` within `OctaGameLogic`.
* **State Synchronization**: All game state (turn, player, etc.) is owned and managed exclusively by `OctaGameLogic` to ensure a single source of truth.

#### 2.3. Chain Reaction Algorithm (Clarification on Complexity)
The propagation loop inside `makeMove` remains the core mechanic.
* **Performance**: The use of `std::unordered_set` for `capturedThisTurn` is required. Its average O(1) lookup time is sufficient for initial requirements. Performance profiling under long chains (>100 cells) is a medium-priority task for post-launch optimization.
* **Error Handling**: See Section 4 for detailed error handling requirements within this algorithm.

### 3. Engine, Flow, and Interfaces

#### 3.1. `MoveProvider` Interface (Resolution to Design Problem)
The `MoveProvider` interface was insufficient. It **must** be updated to receive game state context to make intelligent decisions.
```cpp
class MoveProvider {
public:
    virtual ~MoveProvider() = default;
    // Provides context to the move provider
    virtual std::optional<Coordinate> getNextMove(const IGameMap& map, Player currentPlayer) = 0;
};
```
The `GameEngine` is responsible for passing the current map state and player to this method.

### 4. Error Handling and Exception Safety (New Specification)

#### 4.1. Error Handling Strategy
* **Exceptions**: Invalid operations or states that represent logical programming errors or invalid input **must** be reported by throwing exceptions.
* **Custom Exception Types**: A hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from `std::logic_error` shall be created.
    ```cpp
    // Example in a new "Exceptions.h" header
    #include <stdexcept>
    class OctaCoreException : public std::runtime_error { using std::runtime_error::runtime_error; };
    class InvalidMoveException : public OctaCoreException { using OctaCoreException::OctaCoreException; };
    class InvalidStateException : public OctaCoreException { using OctaCoreException::OctaCoreException; };
    ```
* **`makeMove` Contract**: If `makeMove` is called with a move for which `isValidMove` would return `false`, it **must** throw `InvalidMoveException`.
* **Validation Failures**: User-facing input validation (e.g., in `CLIView`) should handle errors gracefully and prompt for re-entry, not by throwing exceptions that terminate the program.

#### 4.2. Exception Safety
* **Basic Guarantee**: All methods, especially `makeMove`, must provide at least the basic exception safety guarantee. If an exception is thrown, the program state must remain valid and leak no resources.
* **Strong Guarantee**: `makeMove` must provide the strong exception safety guarantee. If the operation fails for any reason (e.g., memory allocation failure), the game state must be rolled back to exactly as it was before the `makeMove` call was initiated.

### 5. Memory Management Policy (New Specification)

A clear memory management policy is required.
* **`GameCell` Objects**:
    * The primary owning pointers (`std::shared_ptr<GameCell>`) shall be held by the `IGameMap` implementation (e.g., in its `unordered_map`).
    * To prevent circular references, a `GameCell`'s pointers to its neighbors **must** be stored as `std::weak_ptr<GameCell>`. When accessing a neighbor, the `weak_ptr` must be locked to create a temporary `shared_ptr`.
* **Interface Pointers**: The `GameEngine` will store its references to `IGameMap`, `IGameLogic`, etc., as `std::shared_ptr`s.
* **Value Types**: Small, copyable objects like `Coordinate`, `GameConfig`, and `GameResult` should be passed and returned by value or `const` reference, not managed by smart pointers.

### 6. Development Process & Tooling (New Specification)

#### 6.1. Testing Framework
* **Requirement**: **Google Test** is the mandated C++ testing framework for this project.
* **Coverage**: All core logic in `OctaGameLogic` must meet a minimum of **85%** test coverage.
* **Test Cases**: Unit tests must exist for every stopping condition, and integration tests must cover full play-throughs for each `WinCondition`.

#### 6.2. Build System
* **Requirement**: **CMake** is the official build system. A root `CMakeLists.txt` must be maintained to build the game executable, the test executable, and manage all dependencies.

#### 6.3. Code Style and Documentation
* **Code Style**: The **Google C++ Style Guide** shall be the coding standard for this project to ensure consistency.
* **Documentation**: All public APIs (headers, classes, methods, enums) **must** be documented using Doxygen-style comments (`/** ... */`).

### 7. Overall Assessment

This v3.0 document resolves the critical gaps identified in the previous review. The data model is now aligned, and clear policies for error handling, memory management, and the development process are in place. This specification is considered complete and stable for the development team to begin implementation.
