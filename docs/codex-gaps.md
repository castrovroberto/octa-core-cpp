Gaps and inconsistencies

Partial implementation of data models
The plan expects each GameCell to track a CellState and a Direction with rotation functionality. However GameCell.h only stores the occupant and neighbors; no field for arrow direction or cell state exists.

Missing Direction rotation helper
The plan specifies a rotateClockwise(Direction) helper. No such function is defined anywhere in the headers or source.

Incomplete map implementation
While GraphGameMap is implemented, ArrayGameMap is merely a placeholder with unimplemented methods throwing exceptions.

Absent game logic layer
The repository lacks any IGameLogic, OctaGameLogic, MoveProvider, or game configuration classes even though these are required in the port plan.

No testing framework or test cases
Both SRDs call for unit and integration tests, yet the repository contains no test files or CMake targets for tests. The CMakeLists.txt includes commented-out lines hinting at GoogleTest but provides no implementation.

Minimal documentation and build instructions
The README simply states “Octa-Core C++ Port” with no instructions on building or running the project. There are no details on environment setup, compilation steps, or dependency versions.

No guidelines for cross-platform integration
Although the goal mentions Godot and Unity support, the plan does not specify how the C++ library will expose interfaces or packaging strategies for these engines.

Unspecified memory management and error-handling policies
The plan does not clarify ownership semantics (e.g., when to use unique_ptr vs shared_ptr) or how errors should propagate beyond simple exceptions.

Overall, while the design documents provide a good high-level blueprint—defining interfaces, expected behavior for game logic, and the data model—many implementation details and development practices are missing or only partially realized in code.
