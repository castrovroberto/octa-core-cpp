 * @class OctaGameLogic
 * @brief Concrete implementation of Octa-Core game logic
 *
 * This class implements the complete Octa-Core game mechanics:
 * - Chain reaction algorithm with octagonal propagation
 * - Win condition checking (elimination and turn limit)
 * - Move validation and execution
 * - Game state management
 * - Configurable safety levels
 *
 * The implementation uses a breadth-first search approach for chain
 * reactions and maintains game state through member variables.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Exception-safe move execution
 * - Configurable chain reaction behavior
 * - Comprehensive win condition support
 * - Efficient neighbor traversal using Direction enum
