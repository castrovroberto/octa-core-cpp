# Octa-Core: Hexagonal Honeycomb Contagion Game - Godot Demo

## Overview

This demo showcases the **Octa-Core C++ hexagonal honeycomb contagion game engine** integrated with **Godot** for a **stakeholder funding presentation**. This demonstrates the **original "Hex Contagion" game format**: **true hexagonal honeycomb cells**, **6-directional arrow system**, and **recursive chain reactions**.

## ✅ **Complete Hexagonal Honeycomb Implementation**

### **🎯 Visual Honeycomb Features**

1. **True Hexagonal Cell Shapes**
   - Custom-drawn hexagonal cells with perfect geometry
   - 6-sided polygons with proper honeycomb structure
   - Visual distinction between player-owned and neutral hexagons

2. **6-Directional Arrow System**
   - Arrows drawn as proper directional indicators
   - 6 compass directions with 60° spacing
   - Visual arrows show precise direction within hexagonal cells

3. **Honeycomb Grid Layout**
   - Proper 6-neighbor connectivity with staggered rows
   - Each hexagon connects to 6 adjacent neighbors
   - Grid supports authentic honeycomb spatial relationships

4. **Custom Honeycomb Rendering**
   - Hexagons filled with player colors (Red/Blue/Gray)
   - Black borders for clear cell distinction
   - Directional arrows drawn with proper arrowheads

### 🎮 **Octagonal Game Rules**

- **Objective**: Capture all enemy octagons through directional contagion
- **Turn Mechanics**: 
  - Select an octagon you own → rotate its arrow clockwise
  - Select a neutral octagon → capture it and rotate its arrow
  - Contagion chain executes automatically following arrow paths
- **Chain Reactions**: Recursive capture through octagonal neighbors
- **Strategy**: Position arrows to create devastating contagion chains through octagonal pathways
- **Players**: Red vs Blue octagons with clear visual distinction
